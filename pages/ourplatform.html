                Hey Lions! My name is Brion Dennis, incumbent ASLMU Chief Programming Officer, and I am a junior Finance and Individualized Studies double major. My name is Camille Orozco, I am a junior Political Science and Music double major, and I am one of the current ASLMU Senators of Diversity and Inclusion. We collectively have five years of experience serving the LMU community as members of ASLMU and are dedicated to continuing our work. This past year, the student body has faced extreme challenges and we are proud of the resilience we've seen despite those circumstances. We dedicate ourselves to rebuilding the passionate Lion community that we have come to know and love by continuing the important work of prior ASLMU administrations and initiatives to which we have both contributed. We honor the past by re-energizing the Menstrual Hygiene Initiative and remaining committed to the work of anti-racism and divestment from institutions that are not in line with the LMU mission.  
                <br>
                <br>
                As we prepare for the upcoming school year, returning to, rebuilding, and reforming our institution in the best interest of our student body is our top priority. We look forward to welcoming students back to campus, and for some, introducing them to the bluff for the first time. We commit ourselves to uplifting student voices and experiences, intentionally fostering a socially just and inclusive environment, and delivering an overall dynamic year as we work to transition from a virtual setting to in-person learning. We are committed to promoting resources regarding student health, wellness, and safety.  
                <br>  
                <br>
                Additionally, we are excited about our plans for the future of LMU and fully intend to equitably serve our communities both on and off-campus. In our platform, we intend to address systemic issues of accessibility by introducing a fly-in program for interested high school seniors coming from First-Generation/Low-Income backgrounds. Further, we intend to reintroduce the Black, Latinx, and Asian Pacific Islander Student Overnight programs in collaboration with Undergraduate Admissions. For those lions returning to campus, we plan to reinvigorate the LMU experience by expanding public student art initiatives. It is our hope that by promoting and invigorating these programs, we can invite the spirit of togetherness back into our campus culture and celebrate the great resilience the LMU community has shown, while also respecting the loss we have collectively endured this past year. We hope you vote for us to Build Back the Bluff!

                    Brion and Camille are committed to prioritizing student wellness as our community navigates a historic <b><em>return</em></b> back to in-person campus life. As candidates for ASLMU President and Vice-President, we feel it necessary to acknowledge the hardships that may follow in our safe return back to campus. Therefore, we intend to strengthen our relationship with Public Safety and Student Psychological Services to best serve the diverse needs of our student body. We find it especially necessary to reach out to those incoming underclassmen and transfer students, for whom it may be their first time on campus, and provide resources to ensure a healthy and happy LMU experience!

                    Brion and Camille understand that what makes LMU so great is its driven and compassionate students. As we return to in-person learning, we dedicate ourselves to <b><em>rebuild</em></b> the passionate Lion community that we have come to know and love. We intend to expand LMU’s presence in an equitable way, by uplifting programming for Black, Latinx, and Asian Pacific Islander high school seniors and introducing a new fly-in program for prospective First-Generation Low-Income students. For those lions returning to campus, we plan to reinvigorate the LMU experience by expanding public student art initiatives and highlighting existing resources for student support, such as the Center for Student Collegiate Recovery. It is our hope that by promoting and invigorating these programs, we can invite the spirit of togetherness back into our campus culture and celebrate the great resilience the LMU community has shown, while also respecting the loss we have collectively endured this past year.

                    <p class="pillar-text">Brion and Camille ensure the student body that the important work of past ASLMU administrations to <b><em>reform</em></b> our university will not be forgotten in our plans for the future. We intend to re-energize the work of the Menstrual Hygiene Initiative, and remain committed to the work of anti-racism and divestment from fossil fuels in our return to campus. We understand that these efforts to expand justice and accessibility can (make or break) one’s college experience, and that is why we intend to advocate for the wellness of all LMU students. Most importantly we are dedicated to fostering trust between ASLMU and the LMU student community. These social justice platforms have built up a community of leaders both on and off the bluff, with the power to create long lasting change. </p>
