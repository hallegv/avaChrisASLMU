                Hi LMU! 
                </br>
                </br>
                My name is <b>Chris Wilson</b>—incumbent Chief Financial Officer of ASLMU—and I am an Accounting and Management & Leadership double major. Outside of ASLMU, I am in Delta Sigma Pi—a professional business fraternity, the secretary of the Accounting Society, and a former member of the Out of State Council. My name is <b>Ava Raymond</b>—Senator-at-Large for ASLMU—and I am an English major with a double minor in Political Science and Business Administration. Outside of ASLMU, I am the Vice President of External Affairs for my sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta, a member of Women in Politics, and a youth delegate for the EcoSocialist party. 
                </br>
                </br>
                Over the past 2 years, we have experienced drastic changes to our campus culture and overall college experiences. Though this period has undoubtedly been challenging for the LMU community, we admire the resilience and support our student body has demonstrated to each other. As we look forward to the future of our campus, we want to empower the LMU community by creating new opportunities on campus and strengthening existing ones. <b>We are driven by a strong conviction to promote the best interests of our student body.</b> Your wellness and safety is our utmost priority, and we are committed to creating an environment that is welcoming, supportive, and inclusive for all students. 
                </br>
                </br>
                With this conviction and our love for ASLMU, we feel well-equipped and eager to represent the LMU community as your <b>2022-2023 President and Vice President.</b> 
                </br>
                </br>
                We are excited to share our platform built on <b>student support, campus-life improvements, and the collective empowerment of student activists.</b> Through our platform, we hope to advocate for your personal well-being by strengthening funding for Student Psychological Services, holding the university accountable in its commitments to anti-racism, supporting funding opportunities for clubs and student organizations, increasing textbook and academic supply funds, and building advocacy coalitions. As students, we resonate and empathize with the concerns related to student life on campus, such as dining hall cleanliness, on-campus food quality, high meal plan costs, strict parking restrictions, and a lack of transportation offered to head off-campus. We will leverage the full power of ASLMU and our collective student voices to address your concerns and build an LMU experience that is completely invested in your empowerment as a member of the Lion community.

            <h1><i>Support</i></h1>
            <p>We are committed to <b>enhancing and strengthening support for all students</b>, increasing access to club and organization funding, pushing the university to allocate more funding to student mental health resources, and recognizing ASLMU’s place as a resource hub for students.</p>

          <div class="col-lg">
            <h1><i>Campus Life Improvements</i></h1>
            <p>We know that <b>positive campus experiences</b> are essential to living and studying at LMU. We  are determined to make sure all Lions have access to high quality and safe eating options, more places to park on campus, and more transportation off campus via our Lyft program. We also believe International Lions should have sufficient access to enough T-work jobs and will dedicate our administration to finding and creating solutions to these problems.</p>

          <div class="col-lg">
            <h1><i>Empowerment</i></h1>
            <p>We believe in empowering and enabling all members of the LMU community <b>to create the world we want to live in</b>. Leveraging the full financial power of ASLMU, we plan to institute an advocacy fund that will financially support the work of both individual students and student organizations while also continuing ASLMU’s commitment to create a fly-in program for prospective First-Generation and Low Income students. We also plan to take measures to hold the university accountable in their commitments to creating a just and anti-racist campus.</p>

              <h1><i>Support</i></h1>
              <p>
                We recognize the strength and power of LMU students and seek to support them in our work. We plan to use the power of ASLMU and the collective strength of our student voices to hold university administration accountable in creating a just and anti-racist campus. <b>It is time for LMU to put its money where its mouth is</b>. We also will begin advocating for the university to provide adequate mental health support. Students should not, under any circumstance, be forced to wait multiple weeks to receive mental health care. Our administration will work with the university to ensure Student Psychological Services are appropriately funded, supported, and staffed with therapists that actually represent the LMU student body and offer supplemental services that offer 24/7 on-demand services to be available to all students. Further, we seek to provide more support to the international student community. We will work with university partners to help create space for International Students to access more T-work jobs and form international student representation on ASLMU.            </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg">
              <h1><i>Funding</i></h1>
              <p>
                We believe that <b>ASLMU should be invested in you</b>. We plan on expanding support to student organizations and clubs through funding opportunities, promoting events via ASLMU communication channels, and working with student groups to ensure they have spaces to book and everything they need to operate successfully. We are also excited to start an ASLMU Advocacy Fund, centered around providing financial support to both individual students and organizations seeking to do advocacy work at LMU and in the community. Finally, we will create an academic resource fund centered around providing financial assistance to students seeking to buy textbooks, course materials, and any other materials students may need to complete their education here at LMU.           </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg">
              <h1><i>Community</i></h1>
              <p>
                We treasure the role ASLMU plays in establishing a sense of community on our campus, and we are excited for the opportunity to further expand our work in this space. Annual events like <b>Fallapalooza</b> and our <b>Christmas Tree Lighting</b> are quintessential pieces to the LMU experience and will receive our full support. We are excited to use these traditions to reestablish ties with the greater Westchester and Playa Vista community and highlight the talents of our own student organizations, artists, and businesses.             </p>

              <h1><i>Food</i></h1>
              <p>
                We understand that food is an essential part of everyday life. What we eat can impact our mental health, physical health, and performance in courses. We will use our lobbying power to advocate for students having access to clean and high quality food. Additionally, we will push the university to lower the costs for students to eat on campus. We will work to remove upcharges on gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan offerings while offering more options for students to choose from. The university should also work to offer bundled flexi-dollars and LION dollars meal plans, as well as low-cost meal plan options that would allow food-insecure students to eat on campus. <b>No student should go hungry</b> while being a member of the LMU community.

              <h1><i>Transportation</i></h1>
              <p>
                We acknowledge that the transportation situation surrounding our campus can be challenging for students. We call upon the university to explore options to lower the cost of parking. Furthermore, parking rules imposed on students should be eased. <b>Students that pay for a parking pass should be able to park almost anywhere on campus</b>, with limited exceptions. To further ease the strain of parking on students and promote nighttime safety, we also plan to work with the university to establish a Lyft program and designated rideshare pick-up and drop-off points. Students will be able to request rides to and from campus at no cost or a lower cost than traditional Lyft rides.            </p>
