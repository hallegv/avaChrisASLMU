                    My name is Chris Wilson, and I am an Accounting and Management & Leadership major. During my time at LMU, I have had exposure to areas all across our campus. I have spent time working with the Office of University Advancement and the Alliance of Women Philanthropists. Additionally, I have served on the First-Year Out of State Council and as the Accounting Society Secretary. I’m also a general member of Delta Sigma Pi, a professional business fraternity on campus. My work on ASLMU has seen me serve as the Assistant Chief Financial Officer and your current Chief Financial Officer. I sit on the University's Board of Trustees Finance and Audit & Risk Committees, as well as Chair the Student Activity Fee Allocation Board. My focus during my time on ASLMU has centered on making sure resources across LMU are adequately and equitably allocated to empower the student body and place each individual and organization in a place to succeed. As ASLMU President, I hope to continue fighting for students to have fair access to resources with a renewed focus on supporting student activists.

                    Hi everyone! My name is Ava Raymond. I am an English major & a Political Science and Business Administration double minor. After feeling deprived from extracurricular activities and social interaction due to  COVID, I vowed to myself that I would never take my opportunities for granted again. Upon arriving on campus for the first time as a sophomore, I joined ASLMU as a Senator-at-Large. As a Senator, I worked hard to pass multiple resolutions advocating for a more sustainable and eco-friendly campus. I am a member of the sorority Kappa Alpha Theta, and sit on its executive board as Vice President of External Affairs. I have also served as Online Media Director and have sat on Theta’s Philanthropy Committee. On campus, I am an active member of Women in Politics. During my time in ASLMU, I have learned about the extensive amount of resources LMU offers as a university. My goal is to not only bring awareness to those resources, but also expand and improve them. The current administration has been working on a coalition for education and prevention of sexual assault. Sexual assault prevention and support for survivors, as well as personal wellness, are causes I am passionate about working on in ASLMU. I would love to have an opportunity to continue building upon what has already been accomplished, my work in sustainability, and improvements to student life on campus as your ASLMU Executive Vice President next year.
